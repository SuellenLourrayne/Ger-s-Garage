Ger, a mechanic who owns a tiny shop and has a small team, performs maintenance inspections on all types of small to medium-sized automobiles. He keeps a stock of standard supplies at his garage and sells them to clients as needed because, in most situations, maintenance checks require components or other supplies. Ger's garage website allows customers to book an inspection or servicing for their vehicles while also allows Ger to advertise his services, manage his schedules and have control of the business profits.
