# Ger-s-Garage
Guided Technology Project - H. Dip. in Computing - CCT College 2022

Ger, a mechanic who owns a tiny shop and has a small team, performs maintenance inspections on all types of small to medium-sized automobiles. He keeps a stock of standard supplies at his garage and sells them to clients as needed because, in most situations, maintenance checks require components or other supplies. Ger's garage website allows customers to book an inspection or servicing for their vehicles while also allows Ger to advertise his services, manage his schedules and have control of the business profits.

##To run the website
1 - You need to run the 'sql.txt' on a mysql database to insert all the necessary tables and to insert the required default information.
2 - You go to the file 'db.js' in the folder 'server > config' to update with your database login information.
3 - In the terminal, you go inside the folder 'server' and run the command 'npm run devStart' to run our server that makes the connection with the database.
4 - Still in the terminal, you go inside the folder 'client' and run the command 'npm install' and then 'npm start' to install the necessary libraries and run the website.
5 - Now you can go into http://localhost:3000/ and make use of the system.
